                      >There is an enormous amount of anger boiling across the
                      United States. Some people are angry at what they see as
                      restrictions on their rights to act, think or behave as
                      they wish. Others are angry because they don’t believe
                      they have the same protection under the law due to their
                      skin color, ethnicity or sexual orientation. One side sees
                      the other as trying to take away what they believe rightly
                      belongs to them. The other side responds that they are
                      only demanding their just share. – From “Anger” by Rabbi

                    I decided to write this column before the election because,
                    no matter who wins, we still have to deal with an issue I
                    wrote about in 2016, 2020 and again this past summer: the
                    anger people feel against those who disagree with them
                    politically. Unfortunately, our country has developed an “us
                    against them” mentality. That is true not only of those who
                    differ on political issues, but on religious ones. The word
                    compromise has come to be a swear word, rather than a path
                    to discover how to best serve the needs of all inhabitants
                    of our country. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a friend who is worried that Sharia law will become
                    the law of our land. I said I didn’t want that either, but
                    it wasn’t until later that I realized I should have added
                    that I don’t want Christian or Jewish law to become the law
                    of our land either. One fundamental ideal of the United
                    States is the freedom to practice our religion. The flip
                    side of that is that we can’t force others to subscribe to
                    our religious values. When I mention Jewish values in this
                    column, I am speaking to those who want to live their lives
                    with Jewish ideals. I don’t expect Christian readers (and we
                    do have some) to follow those values. However, those
                    Christian readers shouldn’t be able to force me or anyone
                    else to subscribe to the ones in which they believe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The irony is that Jews, Christians and Muslims share many of
                    the same values. I’m not talking about theology, prayer or
                    heaven. I’m talking about the way we are supposed to act in
                    this world. All three religions require us to feed the
                    hungry and care for the poor, something that our legislators
                    – even those claiming to be religious – often forget when
                    formulating laws. I’ve seen memes on Facebook from Christian
                    ministers questioning why those running for office ignore
                    the parts of the Bible that require them to care for the
                    less fortunate. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My position may be influenced by the chaplaincy work I do
                    with those who have developmental disabilities. I am
                    everyone’s chaplain and have been know to sing “Jesus Loves
                    Me” to someone who requests that song. When an individual
                    prays using the name of Jesus, I say amen. I encourage a
                    Jewish individual to remember that God loves him, something
                    I have almost never said in a synagogue setting. My mission
                    is to help them not only within their religious tradition,
                    but in a way that meets their needs. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the risk of once again sounding like a broken record, we
                    need to work together – regardless of what political party
                    or religion to which we belong – for the common good. We are
                    all in this together and can accomplish more if we would
                    truly listen to each other. Yes, all sides will need to
                    compromise – a word we must embrace – on some things, but
                    the hope is that the final result will be to allow every
                    member of our country to pursue a life of liberty and
                    happiness as promised by our nation’s Constitution.
